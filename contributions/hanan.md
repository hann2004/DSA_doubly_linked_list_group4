**Role:** Setup, Structure & Initialization

I was responsible for laying the foundation of the project by setting up the basic structure and initialization logic. This includes:

- Including necessary libraries and defining color constants for console output.
- Designing the `Node` struct to represent individual elements in the doubly linked list.
- Creating the `DoublyLinkedList` class with private members for head, tail, and size.
- Implementing the constructor and destructor for proper initialization and cleanup.
- Writing the `clear()` method to safely delete all nodes and reset the list.

my work ensured that the core data structure and memory management were well-organized and efficient, providing a solid base for other functionalities to build upon.
