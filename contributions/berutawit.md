Role: Insertion Methods

I developed all insertion functionalities, allowing users to add new nodes into the doubly linked list in various ways:

- insertAtBeginning(int val) to insert a node at the start of the list.
- insertAtEnd(int val) to insert a node at the end.
- insertAtPosition(int val, int pos) to insert a node at a specific position in the list.

Each insertion method updates the list pointers and size accordingly, and prints the updated list forward for confirmation. my work made it easy and flexible to add elements to the list.
