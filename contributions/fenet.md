Role: Menu Logic & User Input Handling

I completed the program’s main control logic by handling user input and calling the appropriate class methods:

- Validating user input to handle incorrect types gracefully.
- Implementing the switch-case structure that executes the selected operations.
- Providing clear feedback messages for successful operations or errors.
- Handling program termination cleanly.

my contribution ensures smooth, error-resistant interaction and reliable control flow throughout the application.
