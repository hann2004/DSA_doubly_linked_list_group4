Role: Menu Interface

I designed the main menu interface that users interact with. This includes:

- Displaying a clear, color-coded menu with options for all list operations.
- Prompting users for their choice and necessary input values.
- Creating the loop structure that keeps the program running until the user exits.

my work formed the bridge between the user and the linked list functionalities, making the program accessible and user-friendly.
