Role: Display & Search Methods

I implemented the user-facing methods to visualize and search within the list:

- displayForward() to print the list from head to tail.
- displayBackward() to print the list from tail to head.
- search(int val) to find the position of a given value in the list.

I also created a helper method loadSampleData() to initialize the list with sample values for testing. I contributions enhanced the usability and testability of the project.
