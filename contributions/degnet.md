Role: Deletion Methods

I handled the removal of nodes from the list, covering different deletion scenarios:

- deleteAtBeginning() to remove the first node.
- deleteAtEnd() to remove the last node.
- deleteAtPosition(int pos) to delete a node at a given position.

After deletion, the list’s pointers and size are updated properly, and the forward list display is printed to reflect changes. I ensured robust handling of edge cases such as empty lists or invalid positions.
