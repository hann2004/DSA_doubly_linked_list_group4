Invalid input type. Please enter a number.



Note:  
- Use `7` to display the list forward before exiting.  
- Use `0` to exit the program after running each test case.  
- Minor variations in prompts or spacing are fine; focus on core output matching.



### Why this setup rocks:

 **Full feature coverage**: inserts, deletes, displays, searches, and invalid input handling.  
 **Catches errors gracefully**, showing you thought about UX.  
 **Easy manual verification** — just copy-paste inputs, watch outputs, and confirm.

Save this file as `test_cases.txt` alongside your `main.cpp` and `README.md` to make your project look professional and well-tested. If you want, I can help you add screenshots or even automate these tests later!
