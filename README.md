  DSA - Doubly Linked List Project (Group 4)

Welcome to our Data Structures and Algorithms group project! This is a C++ console application that implements a **Doubly Linked List** with full functionality and a clean, interactive terminal interface. It is part of our university coursework under the subject of **Data Structures**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🛠 Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

### ⚙️ Steps

1. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o dll_app main.cpp
````

2. **Run the program**:

   ```bash
   ./dll_app
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive menu** to insert, delete, display, or search elements in the list.



## 📌 Features

* Insert node at beginning, end, or at a specific position
* Delete node from beginning, end, or a specific position
* Search a node by value
* Traverse list forwards and backwards
* Colorful terminal output (with ANSI escape codes)
* Automatically loads a sample list on start
* Clean memory management (deletes entire list on exit)



## 📄 Test Cases

You can find sample test cases in the `test_cases.txt` file. These include:

* Typical insertions and deletions
* Edge cases (e.g. deleting from an empty list)
* Searching for present and absent values
